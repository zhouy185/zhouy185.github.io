<h2 id="notes-on-grading-philosophy">Notes on Grading Philosophy</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Adjustment Based on Contribution</strong>
<ul>
<li>All team members are expected to contribute meaningfully.<br />
</li>
<li>Grades are assigned equally by default but may be adjusted if there is clear evidence of disproportionate contribution, based on peer input, partner feedback, and/or instructor observations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Real-World Project Challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li>These projects involve real-world business data and problems, which can be complex. Our grading priority is <strong>learning</strong> rather than whether your solution is fully optimized or directly useful to the company partner.<br />
</li>
<li>You are expected to <strong>showcase how you applied analytics to solve business problems</strong>, not necessarily to deliver a perfect or complete product.<br />
</li>
<li>If certain tasks are especially challenging, it is acceptable (for grading purposes) to:
<ul>
<li>Complete a smaller, more feasible task well, <strong>and/or</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Provide a clear explanation of your approach, reasoning, and the challenges encountered.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
