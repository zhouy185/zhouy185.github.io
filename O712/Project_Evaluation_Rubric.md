# Project Evaluation Rubric (30 points total)

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Detailed Expectations** | **Points** |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Final Report (12 pts)** | Clarity & Organization | Report is logically structured, with clear writing and well-organized sections. Ideas flow naturally and arguments are easy to follow. | 3 |
|  | Depth & Breadth of Analysis | Analysis shows depth (careful reasoning, insights) and breadth (coverage of relevant aspects). If your project leans more toward data engineering, showcase your methods, how you carried them out, and what you achieved. If it leans more toward insights, showcase your interpretation and what the results mean. | 4 |
|  | Professionalism, Readability & Formatting | Report is polished, free of major errors, and well formatted. Figures/tables are properly labeled. Must also include a **brief statement disclosing how generative AI tools (if any) were used**. | 3 |
|  | Contribution Statement (required, not graded) | **Each member includes a short description of their contributions**. Required but not graded directly. | â€“ |
| **Code & Technical Work (10 pts)** | Correctness & Reproducibility | Code runs without errors, produces results consistent with the report, and includes clear instructions (e.g., README). Data sources are properly referenced. | 4 |
|  | Efficiency & Practicality | Code is reasonably efficient: avoids unnecessary complexity, runs in feasible time for the dataset/problem size, and handles data thoughtfully. | 3 |
|  | Organization, Documentation & Readability | Code is logically structured, uses meaningful variable/function names, includes adequate comments, and avoids clutter or unused code. | 3 |
| **Presentation (8 pts)** | Delivery & Engagement | Presenters speak clearly, confidently, and at an appropriate pace. Time is managed well. Teams are encouraged to share presentation responsibilities. | 3 |
|  | Content & Storytelling | Presentation clearly states the problem, goals, and context; explains the approach and key results; and highlights the value and accomplishments of the project in a way suitable for a business audience. | 3 |
|  | Visual Aids & Professionalism | Slides/visuals are clear and readable (legible text, uncluttered style). Different parts of the presentation are well coordinated, with smooth flow between sections. | 2 |

## Notes on Grading Philosophy

1. **Adjustment Based on Contribution**  
   - All team members are expected to contribute meaningfully.  
   - Grades are assigned equally by default but may be adjusted if there is clear evidence of disproportionate contribution, based on peer input, partner feedback, and/or instructor observations.  

2. **Real-World Project Challenges**  
   - These projects involve real-world business data and problems, which can be complex. Our grading priority is **learning** rather than whether your solution is fully optimized or directly useful to the company partner.  
   - You are expected to **showcase how you applied analytics to solve business problems**, not necessarily to deliver a perfect or complete product.  
   - If certain tasks are especially challenging, it is acceptable (for grading purposes) to:  
     - Complete a smaller, more feasible task well, **and/or**  
     - Provide a clear explanation of your approach, reasoning, and the challenges encountered.
