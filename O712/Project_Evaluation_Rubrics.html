<h1>BUS O712 Course Project Evaluation Rubric (30 points total)</h1>

<h2>Grading Philosophy</h2>
<div class="note"> 
  <p> The projects involve real‑world business data and problems, which can be complex. Our grading priority is <em>learning</em> rather than whether your solution is fully optimized or directly useful to the company partner. You are expected to <em>showcase how you applied analytics to solve business problems</em>, not necessarily to deliver a perfect or complete product. If certain tasks are especially challenging, it is acceptable (for grading purposes) to complete a smaller, more feasible
  task, or provide a clear explanation of the challenges encountered along with well-considered ideas/proposals for how they might be addressed.
</p>

   <p> All team members are expected to contribute meaningfully. Grades are assigned equally by default but may be adjusted if there is clear evidence of disproportionate contribution, based on peer input, partner feedback, and/or instructor observations.</p>
